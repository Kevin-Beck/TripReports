### Pittsburgh to DC: A How To

## Required Warnings

This is not fun. I think in general anyone who does this understands that while parts will be fun in pieces, in general this is a competition to see how much you can endure both physically and mentally. Its easy to shrug off text on a page, but this is a significant trip. I think its a great place to start. As someone with lots of centuries and a taste for pushing personal limits its a perfect first ultra-like event. Its generally flat, it has impressive miles, you're off the road the entire way and there are ample places to stop and adjust if you need. You can stop at bike shops along the way (assuming they're open) and there are 24 hour gas stations and such that you can get to within a reasonable amount of time from the trail. There is also tons of water along the way so you can safely assume you'll have access. This does not mean you can just rock a single water bottle and manage, but it does mean you dont need to pack in 10L of water. All these factors made this a tempting goal to me, I'm on the inexperienced side of things when it comes to super super long rides, but I did it by reading a bunch and trying to find as many helpful tips as possible. I'm hoping arranging all of that info here will assist the next person and really open up the trip to more people.

## History Lesson

Upon my writing of this, I'm seemingly the 8th person to do the trip. Here is what I could find:

1. 24h19m       Tandem Supported    ->  Seth and Rebecca            |   https://bikepgh.org/message-board/topic/pittsburgh-to-dc-in-24-hours-on-a-tandem/
2. 24h37m       Solo Self-supported ->  "GranvilleGravel"           |   https://fastestknowntime.com/route/great-allegheny-passage-gap-co-canal-towpath
3. 23h51m49s    Solo Supported      ->  Sean Crandell               |   https://www.strava.com/activities/1063005822
4. 23h43m10s    Solo Self-supported ->  Chris Shue                  |   https://chrisshue.com/2020/01/21/pittsburgh-express/ | https://www.strava.com/activities/2743790843/overview
5. 23h6m55s     Pair Self-supported ->  Spencer Ralson + Aedan Hale |   https://www.strava.com/activities/3682988560
6. 22h53m47s    Solo Self-supported ->  Kevin Beck                  |   https://www.strava.com/activities/4052875526

Looking at the fastest known time site led me to the above info.

Heres where my novice status really comes through. I was unaware of the difference between self-supported and unsupported. Self-supported is stopping to buy food and snacks and anything else along the way, unsupported is carrying everything you need except publicly available naturally sourced water. I could have done this ride unsupported, it would have been slightly worse, but it could have been done. From deeper analysis I'll break things into 2 catagories.

- T0 -> an all out fastest possible time solo **un**-supported, I would have liked to have gone for this in the first place but lesson learned.
- T1 -> shooting for sub 24 solo **self**-supported, This seems to be the goal of most and as Shue stated something like millions could do it. 

## Training

I'll be the first to admit I am not a cyclist in the most sinere way. I've always biked in huge bursts where I take it extremely seriously for 4-6 months and then stop riding for a year. I've been trying to get more consistent but no matter what your background is, doing this trip means you need to ride. You need to ride A LOT.

Here are the pieces of data for riding history for the above riders who had strava linked:

OK OK OK before you start into how I didnt train properly I was doing a very strict very significant lifting routine for November through February. This taught me a whole slew of things that I didnt know before, I'll get into this later. The main point is, while it looks like I wasnt biking. I was staying extremely on top of my fitness through the winter, and I had biked a similar summer the year prior. So I wasnt completely unprepared. But yeah the rest of these guys are legends.

Things to note. Chris de

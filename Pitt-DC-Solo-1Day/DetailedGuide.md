### Pittsburgh to DC: A How To

## Required Warnings

This is not fun. I think in general anyone who does this understands that while parts will be fun in pieces, in general this is a competition to see how much you can endure both physically and mentally. Its easy to shrug off text on a page, but this is a significant trip. I think its a great place to start. As someone with lots of centuries and a taste for pushing personal limits its a perfect first ultra-like event. Its generally flat, it has impressive miles, you're off the road the entire way and there are ample places to stop and adjust if you need. You can stop at bike shops along the way (assuming they're open) and there are 24 hour gas stations and such that you can get to within a reasonable amount of time from the trail. There is also tons of water along the way so you can safely assume you'll have access. This does not mean you can just rock a single water bottle and manage, but it does mean you dont need to pack in 10L of water. All these factors made this a tempting goal to me, I'm on the inexperienced side of things when it comes to super super long rides, but I did it by reading a bunch and trying to find as many helpful tips as possible. I'm hoping arranging all of that info here will assist the next person and really open up the trip to more people.

## History Lesson

Upon my writing of this, I'm seemingly the 8th person to do the trip. Here is what I could find:

1. 24h19m       Tandem Supported    ->  Seth and Rebecca            |   https://bikepgh.org/message-board/topic/pittsburgh-to-dc-in-24-hours-on-a-tandem/
2. 24h37m       Solo Self-supported ->  "GranvilleGravel"           |   https://fastestknowntime.com/route/great-allegheny-passage-gap-co-canal-towpath
3. 23h51m49s    Solo Supported      ->  Sean Crandell               |   https://www.strava.com/activities/1063005822
4. 23h43m10s    Solo Self-supported ->  Chris Shue                  |   https://chrisshue.com/2020/01/21/pittsburgh-express/ | https://www.strava.com/activities/2743790843/overview
5. 23h6m55s     Pair Self-supported ->  Spencer Ralson + Aedan Hale |   https://www.strava.com/activities/3682988560
6. 22h53m47s    Solo Self-supported ->  Kevin Beck                  |   https://www.strava.com/activities/4052875526

Looking at the fastest known time site led me to the above info.

Heres where my novice status really comes through. I was unaware of the difference between self-supported and unsupported. Self-supported is stopping to buy food and snacks and anything else along the way, unsupported is carrying everything you need except publicly available naturally sourced water. This is as described by the FastestKnownTime website which caters to hikers and runners, but I figured I'd use these classifications here. I could have done this ride unsupported, it would have been slightly worse, but it could have been done. I also think for a fastest time, you might as well carry everything anyways. For deeper analysis I'll break things into 2 catagories.

- T0 -> an all out fastest possible time solo **un**-supported, I would have liked to have gone for this in the first place but lesson learned.
- T1 -> shooting for sub 24 solo **self**-supported, This seems to be the goal of most and as Shue stated something like millions could do it. 

### Training

I'll be the first to admit I am not a cyclist in the most sinere way. I've always biked in huge bursts where I take it extremely seriously for 4-6 months and then stop riding for a year. I've been trying to get more consistent but no matter what your background is, doing this trip means you need to ride. You need to ride A LOT.

Here are the pieces of data for riding history for the above riders who had strava linked:

OK OK OK before you start into how I didnt train properly I was doing a very strict, very significant lifting routine for November through February. This taught me a whole slew of things that I didnt know before, and prepared me a lot more than I realized to do this ride. I'll get into this later. The main point is, while it looks like I wasnt biking. I was staying extremely on top of my fitness through the winter, and I had biked a similar amount of miles in the summer the year prior. So I wasnt completely unprepared. But yeah the rest of these guys are legends.

Things to note. The highlighted bar is the week of the route. I had to splice annual charts for Chris to make it fit correctly. These guys bike. This is not a thing you can just reach out and do. You have to put in the miles. You have to know how to do big time mileage and you need to be comfortable with some semblance of training. They're in order of completion (I think).

Have a look at Sean's preparation. He's scaling up into enourmous mileage and he was riding weekly through the winter (are you riding weekly through the winter? well you better pick it up then). Then check out Chris, he's got some monster randonneuring experience earlier in the year having done even more miles during a week 6 weeks ahead of this solo ride. These guys put in a ton of biking to be prepared, and were familiar with the task at hand. Spencer is a triathlete machine. His output put fear into me everytime I opened strava. Casual 80mi morning rides with 9mi runs in the evenings. Come on man. And Aedan having a constant output year round, knocking out 200+ mile weeks in February? What I'm getting at is if you're thinking about doing this ride and you arent making 150mi weeks the norm you are probably not pushing out enough hours of cycling. Ok Kevin, but what about you, why dont I just copy you so I dont have to spend 6+ months training. Because I have some unique history that gave me a boost. I had previously done a cross country solo bike tour... without really knowing what I was doing and not really knowing how to camp. It was a disaster, but through this disaster came a lot of understanding of my limits and what breaks me. So while I wasnt spending a lot of time on my bike in comparison, I knew I had the legs to get me through, and I knew exactly what was going to stop me. I spent all my energy learning about how to stop myself from hitting any walls along the way. In retrospect should I have trained more, yeah sure. Its easy to say you should have trained more. But was that my biggest failing? probably not. Also almost every mile of my training was on the GAP, I became extremely familiar with the entire 145 miles and while that doesnt seem like much of a help, knowing exactly how to manage your first 8 hours helps smooth things over greatly. Also, there is a lot of room for improvement in other areas outside of training. Its less about fitness than it seems on the surface.

# T0

Scale up your riding to 250+ miles a week (Hey I said this was going to be all out). Do almost all of your riding on the Gap or C&O. If you dont have access then find something as similar as possible. Work through every single step of your water and hydration needs. Take notes on how hot it was, how much water did you drink per mile? per hour? After your ride did you weigh significantly less than you did before you left? You feel pretty good after a ride even if you're severly dehydrated. That doesnt really set in unless you're on the longer rides.

Use your long rides to the fullest. These are your safe test cases. Pack all your bags, put them on your bike and go do a 200 mile ride with a heart rate monitor. Was your pacing on point? How much water did you need? Will you need to have even more water on board? Is there a certain threshold of heat or humidity that changes your game in a severe way? These are the things to sort out.

I'd recommend at least two 200+ rides in preparation. I'd do 1 on the Gap and 1 on the C&0, preferably the starting from the point in pittsburgh for the gap ride and ending at mile marker 0 for the c&o ride. This will get you familiar with the starting and ending points which will free you up to focus on just the cycling when it comes time. Fully load your bike, execute your plan of no stopping except for water. Practice eating on the bike. This comes up in the next section but you need to completely understand how many calories you are actually burning. The best way to do this is to track every calorie on and off the bike and compare mileage from week to week. You'll get a rough estimate of how many calories cycling costs. Sprinkle in normal road cycling if you want, but I'm making this plan as if your entire life revolves around doing this GAP + C&O ride as fast as possible.

I will admit when it comes to training I'm not a super reliable source for information. I tend to get good results from "bike as hard as possible as much as possible when you feel like it." I've gotten better at taking rest days or 3 when something was feeling off. Getting max efforts and max data out of your rides goes a long way. Some may disagree and prefer a more 40 miles a day at race pace stratagy, but bursty big rides seemed to work for me.

# T1

Scale your riding to at least 150 miles a week. You need to feel comfortable on your seat and you need to be very confident in your body positioning. The miles will come with time. The longer you can be riding at 150+ the easier this will be. Your pace needs to be quick but not fast. You have time to stop and rest so practice timing your stops. Learn what it really means to stop for 5 minutes. Go bike 30 miles without stopping, set a timer for 5 minutes and get back on and ride home. Then think about doing that 5-6 more times. Does that seem unreasonable? Why? Work through those answers as you build up miles and consistency with your pace. I'd recommend getting a lot of miles on the gap. Also it would be good to get some practice stopping at sheetz. Like the stop in Connellsville or any other small towns. If you can know how to get to and from the trail efficiently as well as get in and out as fast as possible that would be great. If you're riding with a friend knowing who will get in line and who will refill waters and such would be good to plot out as well.

Another thing about practicing your stops is you'll want to know when to bail. If you get to a spot and you really need food, you might have to suck it up and wait the 20 minutes at a busy gas station. To avoid this you will want to know when to order food, when to grab a energy drink and go, and when to just abandon ship and get back to the trail. You should plan your stops ahead of time, but always have enough supplies to make it to the next one so you're flexible enough to skip some long lines if need be.

I would highly recommend getting at least some miles on the C&O before making a go of it. Its quite a different animal and will certainly slow you down.

### Nutrition

First you're going to want to know exactly what food you will want to take, this will come with training. You will learn what you do and dont like to eat, and espeically what you dont like to eat after 100 miles. Your tastes change pretty significantly based on how much you're working and sweating and a lot of times I'd be really put off by something that I usually love and start day dreaming of some obscure salty snack or whatever. Its a matter of honing in on what you like and then how you manage eating it. A good portion of the food I took I ended up not eating, I had expected to be more interested in some stuff but couldn't stomach it. You should be practicing all of this on every single ride.

Heres a list of what I took, it was enough calories, but I didnt finish a lot of it.

![](Images/Food.jpg)

- 5x Cosmic brownies (love these, pack alright, high calories)
- 12x GU without caffeine (Picked these up just for the trip, needed more easy to eat calories and they were a life saver)
- 3x Banana (classic, put em in my jersey to start off)
- 1x Nuun tablets (40mg caffeine and vitamins, just figured itd - be something other than scratch)
- 10x Scratch (put in every bottle I had until I was out)
- 4x Creme Cheese and Chives (favorite crackers)
- 6x Quest protein bars (pretty regular thing for me to eat)
- 1x Massive mixed bag of banana/pineapple chunks
- 5x Kind bars (pretty regular riding food for me)

Everything in green I ate, the red were some pretty bad sticking points worth mentioning. The protein bars were the worst, it was like my body knew it was fake sugar and didn't want any part of it. The cosmic brownies were also tough to stomach. I used to like eating them but I think those rides were a bit less strenuous.

I started off with the GU in a cup holder bag along with some salt tablets that are not pictured. I tried to eat a salt tablet every 2 hours or so during the day in addition to the food in order to make up for the sweat. I sweat a lot. The crackers were awesome, but kinda hard to eat. The dryness makes it pretty easy to breathe cracker dust in, but man I just love these crackers. I also burned through the kind bars pretty quick.

My first few hours were:
- Banana + Kindbar + Scratch
- Banana + Crackers + Scratch

When the bananas ran out I switched to other foods. But would have liked to have stuck with that rotation. The GU was amazing but I saved it for much later when I didnt feel like chewing.

In retrospect I would have done twice as many kind bars and crackers 6 more GU and cut the protein and brownies. It would have been nice to have more bananas but they're hard to carry and pack. Also more scratch would have been nice, I didnt like the Nuuns I took when I got to that point. I also should have made little bags of the pineapple and the bananas. I only had one big bag which meant I could only have them during stops.

I think my carb limit is about 100g of carbs / hour. But I only averaged like 60g of carbs / hour for the whole trip.

I also forced fluids the entire time. The only way I knew I was hydrating properly was if I was peeing. My strategy was "Do I have to pee? no -> drink gulp of water, yes -> drink sips of water." Then I held my pee as long as I could to avoid unneeded stops (at least at the beginning when I wasnt constantly stopping).

Another thing to note is I hit breakfast pretty hard, I had 3 eggs, 3 pieces of toast, a monster of a PB&J and as much gatorade as I could chug. I wanted to be bursting with sugar at the start. More on this in the execution section.

At my only stop I ate a rice crispy treat and 3 chicken wraps. I then picked up 2 Monster Maxx cans. I drank 1, but I shoud have picked up more cans because this ended up being basically the end of my caffeine, which was rough.

# TO

You have to know **everything** about what you will need. You're going to pack in all food and not stop anywhere, so you need the exact amount of calories with a little buffer. You cant underestimate. You will want to track every calorie during your training along with your weight. Use any tracking app but use it constantly. Before and after rides weigh yourself. You'll want to be trying to get your pre-ride weight into a narrow enough window and make sure you're finishing at the same weight (meaning you're not losing water). This will let you know exactly how much water to be drinking. 

Then take the number of miles you do per week and divide by the number of calories. Or subtract off your basal metabolic amount from each day if you can get it close. Again you'll want to over estimate on how many calories you burn on the bike but there is an upper limit to how much your body can absorb. Assuming you havent been losing weight and assuming you're able to keep decent track of all calories, you should now know about how many calories you burn per mile and also per hour. Using these values you can estimate your need for your bike trip.  The vast majority of your intake should be carbs and you should not be letting a single 30 minute block pass without eating something. 

My biggest piece of advice here is to really really know what you like and give yourself options. If you like 6 foods, take ample amounts of all 6 and then force yourself to eat the ones you arent feeling as much at the beginning. At the end you're going to be depending on the GU or whatever is easiest.

Also consider how you're going to do caffeine. I find it hard to imagine you're reading this and also a person who doesnt drink a lot of coffee or whatever. You'll need to sort out exactly how you'll dose this out, this seems like a pretty personal thing so I'll leave this up to you

# T1

I'd recommend if you're trying to do a sub 24 to limit the amount of stuff you're carrying. Just bring a bit more than you need to accomplish the miles to the next stop. I'd also recommend carrying enough to make it to the next stop incase you have an issue and need to skip a town, plus it opens up your options a little. The best thing you can do is really really understand your stops. You'll be able to comfortably pick up food at your stops so just know what you'll want as you approach. Then know how to get to and from your stops correctly.

The above T0 information won't be a important because you'll have the options to refuel as needed during these pit stops and that should really help smooth out your riding. I would recommend doing some practice stops in training and timing them out. Find out what an average stop is for you and then make sure you arent scheduling too many for you to make it in by the 24 hour mark. They add up super quick. A 15 minute stop is very very easy to do, 25 minutes will sneak up on you really quick. 4 towns at 25 minutes will pretty much ruin your chances. You'll want to keep tabs on it during the ride to see if you'll need to skip a stop. Also dont go too wild with the food. Sometimes having so many options will be dangerous, you'll get a little too aggressive with "I love spicy cheese chips" or whatever, but then an hour later be suffering with an upset stomach. So know your limits and do what you need to do.

# Pittsburgh to DC in under 24 hours
More specifically: Biking the Greater Allegheny Passage and C&O Canal Trail Solo Unsupported


As someone who loves to analyze things, prepare for a lot of overanalyzing. I'm going to go all the way through every step of this trip in a way that I wish existed when I decided to take this on. Hopefully someone is reading this because they want to take on this awful challenge and I'm going to do everything in my power to make you think "Oh this doesnt seem that bad, maybe someday." Then the idea burns for a while and you'll come back looking for all these tips. To save everyone else the agony of reading through the overly detailed info, first things first.


## Trip Report

# Greater Allegheny Passage

I triple checked that I had everything sorted at attached correctly, stuffed the food that wouldnt fit in my bags into my jersey's back pockets and left the house. I biked from Bloomfield down to point state park. I have been here a whole bunch of times on a whole bunch of rides, but I had never been this nervous. I sent my wife and inspiration a text "I'm at the point" and I was full of cautious confidence on the "You are strong!" response. The ride out of Pittsburgh can at times be a little confusing for people doing the trip and its not unusual to find adventurers seeking confirmation that they're on the right path. There are also 2 points during the first few miles where you are at the mercy of stop lights and traffic which can interupt the flow pretty significantly. Upon hitting both of these lights.... THEY WERE GREEN! What a great sign, out of Pittsburgh and onto the open trail.

The GAP is paved for a lot of miles out of the city and its easy to get carried away, I wear a heart rate monitor and had that front and center on my bike computer. Talking myself back down when my heart rate hit 155+. There are far too many miles ahead to be excessively burning energy. Pace was important for me here. I passed a few people but there were never any crowds that made passing slow or difficult. Easy sailing past all my normal turn around spots and after an enjoyable morning ride I was at my first stop.


**0mi -> 60mi  |  Average Speed: 17.8  |  Miles to go: 273**


I bought 2 energy drinks a huge rice crispy treat and 3 chicken wraps which I ate as fast as possible after waiting about 10 minutes. It was during this wait that I realized I didn't *need* to stop and get food and supplies. I was carrying more than enough food to get me through to the end and there are relatively frequent spots to get free water along the trail. So this was it. I previously thought about not stopping but thought I could use the breaks effectively. Standing waiting for food however was not a good use of time. So thats it. No more stopping at shops. Off to take on the mountain.


**60mi  -> 110mi  |  Average Speed: 16.4  |  Miles to go: 223**
**110mi -> 120mi  |  Average Speed: 16.4  |  Miles to go: 213**


There is one climb on the GAP and its a long one, you climb up and up and up. Realistically its not a huge climb in elevation, about 1500ft, but its just. so. long. About 60 miles long slowly climbing up. It might not seem like much of a gradiant but its a stark contrast to the truly flat first 60 miles. I'm breaking this into 2 parts, the part where I was still feeling good, and the part that I was not so happy about.

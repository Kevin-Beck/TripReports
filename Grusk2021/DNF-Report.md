## Grusk 2021 Venti


This is gonna be a short one, but I feel I owe it to myself to document it as well as possible. It is now 3 after the event and I feel fully rested and healed, primarily due to the fact that my ride was cut short due to a mechanical (broken derailleur).

# Required Warnings

This is not a road race. Though it may take place on the majority of roads and gravel roads you shouldnt be on the grusk course (at least the venti) without understanding just how significant the riding is. I likely would not have finished even without the mechanical issues I faced. The trails/woods the course takes you through are brutal. The terrain is hike a bike for significant portions and parts of the trail seem more like suggestions than trails. However, with tempered expectations and a solid understanding of the course the riding is only quite hard. The elevation and mileage is certainly significant, but I found the trail conditions to be a much much greater influence to my outcome (obviously with the mechanical but also I felt fit enought to finish that distance/elevation). If you have been training and are in solid double century shape you are physically prepared. 

# Goals And Expectations

My plan was to either finish in one shot or quit. This mentality was probably detrimental looking back but I thought I had good enough odds at finishing to make that my goal. Here were my basic state of mind for each of my goals


1. Finish without sleeping and minimal stopping time. I felt confident that I would be able to finish the course. It might not have been pretty and I would have been crushed and exhausted but I didnt truly expect to not be able to physically complete the course. This was a 

2. Finish in under 24 hours with less than 3 hours of stopped time. This was my best worst-case scenario. I imagined a situation where I had multiple flats, got overly tired and slowed to a crawl but limped back to camp with sub 10mph average speed. 

3. Finish in under 20 hours with less than 90 minutes stopped. This was my worst best-case scenario. Cruising along, maintaining good pace and struggling through but making it in great time. The idea being that if I left at 5am I'd have gotten back at 1am which would have allowed me to sleep a normal night before having to wake up. Avoiding the 24 hours awake thing is always great.

4. Finish in under 18 hours. My best case scenario. This was where my pure fitness was at. I think if I was sitting on a trainer or doing well known hilly gravel routes that I'm familiar with I could do 213 miles and 18,000ft of elevation in 18 hours. Grusk Venti was not that course. This is where I really was hoping to end up. I wanted the feeling of racing your best race. Knowing your performance was your raw effort materialized in an event.

5. Finish in 'daylight' hours only (basically minimize night riding completely) This was a pipe dream. I thought if the wind was always at my back and my bike grew sails I could maybe complete the race with minimal night riding.


Obviously none of these were my reality but if I could make by best guess I'd assume my true ability sans mechanical catastrophe was number 2. I was ill prepared for the terrain and had no hope of doing the loftier goals without divine intervention.


# Training

For once in my life I really tried to train for this. I rode my bike with purpose for almost the entire year prior to this event. I had some weeks off but I dont mind that kind of rest from time to time sprinkled across a year. I rode the trainer through the winter and focused heavily on heart rate type stuff. Keeping my heart rate under 155 or 160 or even doing sub 140 heart rate rides. I also focused on putting out huge efforts on some segments outside in an attempt to push maximal efforts from time to time. I think it was a beginners approach to polarized training. I did occassionally creep into that zone 3 or 4 overdoing it every ride trap on a few weeks which required significant rest to reset. This was my biggest mistake and what I take forward into the next year. Over training just leads to diminished enthusiasm and forced rest.

I spent a significant amount of time cycling in san francisco which was really a truly great experience. I got tons of time riding big long hills and cool fire roads and rough gravel roads. The amount of climbing I did in the spring of 2021 probably came close to outdoing my climbing of 2020. I carried that momentum back to Pittsburgh and tried to find more hilly routes to put in that climbing time. I did a few practice rides that I hoped were similiar to the Grusk route. My favorite being a 50 mile loop called the bavington 50 near hillman state park that I did twice to create a 100 mile 11000 foot route. It was 50% gravel roads and 50% paved roads. I hoped this was going to compare to about half the Grusk course. The venti had 80 miles of paved roads and 130 miles of gravel with 18,000ft of climbing. However the conditions of the bavington 50 is entirely road where as the grusk contains significant off road gravel and trail riding.

As for my fitness I felt very much prepared for the physical aspect but could have dont much better training for the actual event and not focusing on the numbers. Had I taken a trip to the course to do parts of it I would have been much much more prepared. This was great because I do get caught up on the fitness side of things without understanding the benefit of actual experience and course knowledge. More training on the actual event and knowing what the event will bring is much more valuable than being 3% stronger.

# Nutrition

Man was I ready for this part. I took all the food I'd need to survive the 24 hour course. I went with a carry everything approach and assumed I'd pay the price over every mile but benefit from shorter or non-existant stops. This was what I really learned from the GAPCO ride last year. During GAPCO I made a costly error stopping for food rather than taking enough to just push through. This time I carried an extreme amount of GU and Cliff Chews. I also made and packed 3 potato wraps (take a large tortilla and put in a few scoops of instant potato, roll it into a tight wrap, put it into a bag or aluminum foil) that were 500+ calories each. The potato wraps were a thing I experimented with as a way to have 'real' food that gives you that full feeling while being primarily carbs. They are super easy to eat and keep down but they dont taste sweet and they stay nice in a back pocket without much issue. 

Nutrition was another spot where I was focused on errors of my past rather than applying best practices to the event at hand. I think these wraps are great and I think carrying tons of nutrition and eating constantly is a key component a lot of people miss out on. However, I carried a lot. I think I would have eaten it all but the cost of hauling all that food up every hill was probably questionable. If it was GAPCO I was perfectly prepared. I was applying my minimal experience of "this is what i struggled with" and trying to fix up my issues to preform better at Grusk. But by doing that I completely missed the event. I should have saved the 20+ hours of reading white papers and driven or walked the course. I would have gained far more with actual hands on experience rather than waste time figuring out if I can absorb 80g or 90g of sugar per hour.

# Gear

More of the same here. I prepared to fix all my gear problems from GAPCO and do better at Grusk. Simple fact my bike is not meant for this level of abuse. Trek Domane is a great *road* bike. Meaning reasonable gravel roads, rough semi-broken pavement, and tarmac. It is not meant for grass, deep puddles, creek crossings, large rock, etc. I also ran my normal tires (32mm 700c) because they worked well enough on fireroads and other gravel segments I had done in preparation. I should have been on 38mm or knobbier 34mm. My 32mm slicks were just not enough to comfortably manage the size of some of the gravel on downhill sections.

I took were 2 water bottles and a 1.5L water bladder. I took tons of gu and other nutrition as mentioned. This seemed like the right amount of water and slightly overkill on food potentially.

I had a medical kit with some tylenol I believe a suture kit and some bandages as well as other medical creams. Didnt get far enough to dig into this, but I felt confident in what I had.

Desperate times call for desperate measures kit which had a sawyer water purifier, a mylar blanket, and some paracord. This was the bag I put at the bottom and hoped to not see again.

Also took in a small tool kit, 2 tubes, a patch kit, hand pump, chain breaker, master link, leatherman wave+, bike hex tool, tire lever. This was the right amount of stuff although I think had I made it farther I would have been deep in the patch kit. For future reference I'd consider taking more tubes or patch kits if riding such rough terrain. Also this could potentially be mitigated by running better bikes/wheels/tires.

Final kit was electronics. I had a fenix BC30 light that I bought due to lackluster lighting from the GAPCO ride. It performed great at the beginning and I didnt make it very long after that. I carried spare batteries for it, also a 10,000 battery pack, cables for the wahoo and phone, and a back up tail light.

I will return in the future to outline exactly what I took but I dont have it on hand at the moment. (today is 7/11/21 and if you see this later then I guess I didnt come back).

# Bike Setup

I was very particular about how to set up my bike and stuff, I spent a lot of time tinkering with different bags and so on and I wasnt very settled going into the start of the Grusk. I meant to be better about nailing this stuff down but I think I'm partially concerned with the next next next ride when it comes to buying gear. I should have spent more time focusing just on doing the next event and less time concerned with how this gear can be used down the line. I ran aero bars and a bag that sits under the aero bars. That bag held my water. I think this works ok until I can figure out a framebag for water. Top tube bag had money, phone, and chamios cream packet and some gu/bars. I used a large apidura bag off the seat post where I put everything else. This is really the flaw of the setup.

In the future I'd think using a framebag for water/food would help balance out the weight a lot better. The front and rear bag could hold mechanical/emergency/backup etc and be significantly smaller and lighter. No matter the race or event I feel this would be optimal moving forward.

I also had a little extended bar for holding my light but that was a bit sub-optimal. I think being able to utilize the bar space better by not running a front bag or by managing the light position elsewhere would be optimal. I also like the idea of a hubbed wheel (which is currently being built out) so maybe we'll switch to that for the next ride.

# Weather / Route

The weather was great, it was rainy and foggy and wet. But I much preferred that to hot, sweaty and dusty. I honestly dont know if I would have changed anything about the weather. The day ended up breaking (after I was scratched) so it did heat up some but there was no downpour or thunderstorming and there wasnt 80+ degree temperature. After mechanical failure heat is my greatest nemesis so rain and cool will always be preferred.

The route was.. just.. yeah. Its a very hard route. I think the elevation and the gravel etc are all super great. I think the offroad sections are pretty ambitious. I should have taken the warnings a little more seriously. Grusk Venti is definitely borderline mountain biking and even then there are significant parts that seem just unridable. It wasnt the challenge I was looking for and I'm stoked people can do it. I keep going back and forth on trying it again in the future, but maybe its just not my style of riding.

# Execution

This is the saddest section for me.

First we camped out the night prior to the race. I usually dont mind sleeping in a tent but the wind and rain kept me up later than usual. I also had been sleeping in til 9am pretty regularly. I should have started rolling back my sleep schedule a bit to prepare for the earlier start. This is just my night owl tendencies not cooperating with event start times. I also could have just admitted this issue and not started early but I woke up at 4:45am after a few hours of sleep and decided I was up and that I may as well just start. This was probably a fine decision but after the cascade of failures leading to this 5am start it was probably unwise.

One of the highlights of the ride was rolling with Blaise and Mike (who went on to finish in 17 hours total) during the starting section. It was really great talking with them and watching them ride. I have limited group riding experience so even talking to cyclist while riding was exciting lol. As we approached the first big climb it was obvious me and my bike are heavier than they are. To really compete at this level theres no way around losing 20+ pounds. I have always been a pretty heavy dude but there are massive disadvantages to weighing over 200lbs. They climbed ahead of me and left me to my spinning. It was nice having the tire treads to follow though. I knew there were after it and if I had passed them it would have been a huge victory for me. I was fine trying to finish on my own time and while it was great pacing with them it wasnt worth over working the first 30 miles on such a long solo event.

Then came the drop. The last thing Blaise had said to me was about the drop on the other side of the climb. He warned it was pretty technical and the gravel was rough. Well... I got a flat. I hopped off the bike and went to work. I kept repeating that running into mechanical issues was just part of the race. I felt like I fixed the flat quickly but I'll admit to maybe 10 minutes from off to on the bike. However there was an additional 5 to 10 while I was unable to get up to a pressure I wanted. I continued the descent after the fixed flat and felt pretty good. I was getting frustrated by the delay but was back to riding. It was at this point I realized I had left my glasses 5 or so miles back up the hill. I wasnt going back. Riding without glasses in the misting rain for 180 more miles was already a lot to ask but I figured I'd be alright as the speed wasnt ever going to be blisteringly fast and hopefully my poor eyes would hold up alright.

The course took a nice weaving road through some observatory satellite dishes and then suddenly started back a grassy trail. I followed the tire marks and made my way through some rougher and rougher terrain. Eventually I was just biking on what felt like an old overgrown hiking trail. Numerous times I looked down at my gps route to decide if I should veer in a direction. The trail was almost impossible to follow. Maybe I'm just naive but I was definitely not prepared for this type of riding.

Through this kind of thick wooded area I knew I was just destined to start walking the bike. I made it rhough to a climbing section and hopped back on the bike, hoping to go 5mph instead of 2. As I climbed up the trail became clearer and I made my way. During this uphill I clipped the edge of a small log with my front wheel. My view was obstructed by the front bag at such a slow speed. I had been distracted by the routing and directions and failed to see the log in the grass. The log flipped upright and hit my rear derailleur. It snapped at the joint and was absolutely trashed. At first I thought it was just badly bent but as I used my pliers to try to realign it, the damage made itself known. Immediately I knew I was out but I didnt want to believe it. The frustration of my own lack of control and the nature of the course boiled over. I had a little moment of pure anger and then had some food and sat down. I was only 38ish miles into the race and almost certainly doomed to not finish. My pace was absolutely great. I wasnt tired. I had plenty of time still. I decided to just see how far I could get from here.

I had recently learned how to fix a chain thanks to my wife so I figured maybe I could shorten the chain enough to make it a single speed. I snapped the chain off. And removed the broken rear. I picked the 5th lowest gear and the big ring on the front, My thinking was if I needed to I could potentially do this again with the small front ring and another gear if I needed to. I had tried doing the chain trick without using a master link by just using the pin but I knew it would be hard. Master link was much easier. 

I started biking off. I could climb in the single speed gear but it wasnt pretty. Surprisingly the single speed held and I managed to continue onward. I made it about 4 miles before the chain started hopping around a bit. At first it was just under major loading. So i lightened up and tried to hold my watts steady during the approaches if the climbing got steep. I also started walking the bike if the hills were bad. I managed to get about 15 miles beyond the point of catastrophe before realizing the chain was hopping more and more and more. Eventually it was obvious I was only making it harder for myself to be found. I backtracked 4 miles or so to Durbin and found a public wifi to call for a pick up.

This would be the end of my 2021 Grusk Venti ride.

# Data

After reviewing the data I feel a lot less bad about my performance. I opened with exactly the amount of effort I was hoping to put out there. My first 32 miles took me 2 hours 27 minutes with a stopped time of 1 minute. I had an average heart rate of 155 which was the upper barrier I was shooting for. I was hoping to stay right at 155 for a good portion of the race so that seemed really nice. I felt really good riding along side Blaise and Mike and it was aggressive but within reason.

The first 32 miles included a 1 hour, 8 mile climb of 1680ft. It was a great effort by my standards and fit right along what I had planned to do for the climbing parts. I figure anything above 7mph during every climb would be plenty fast enough to get me through. 

As for the last 25 miles of my ride? 2 hours 36 minutes with 56 minutes of stopped time. This included a significant amount of hike a biking and such. 20 minutes of the stopped time was a flat change and 36 was doing the chain derailleur rig up. I also finished with 13 miles with 6 minutes of stopped time. I just really like this last 13 miles because its pretty funny that it was all on single speed rigged up chain. It took me an hour and a half to get those 13 miles done but I was determined to keep at it. I think seeing this after the fact helps me sleep at night. I did whatever I could to get the most out of the experience. It was cut short but so be it. Live to fight another day.
